This repository demonstrates a common React useEffect issue where the cleanup function isn't triggered on component updates.  The bug.js file shows the initial implementation that incorrectly handles the cleanup.  The bugSolution.js file provides the corrected implementation.  The issue arises from incorrectly using an empty dependency array in useEffect, causing the cleanup function to execute only once during mounting, not subsequent updates. The solution modifies the dependency array to include the relevant state variable, resulting in the cleanup executing whenever the state changes.
